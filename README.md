# Doxygen Note

## Installation

### Ubuntu 20.04

For Ubuntu 20.04, before installing the Doxygen, some other packages/libraries should be installed first. 
The following list can be helpful:
1. CMake: one can directly download the binary `.sh` file from [CMake Download](https://cmake.org/download/), and run something like: `/bin/sh cmake-3.22.1-linux-x86_64.sh`.
2. GNU flex: simply run: `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install flex`.
3. GNU bison: `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install binson`.
4. libiconv: follow the guide here: [Installing libiconv on Ubuntu Linux](https://geeksww.com/tutorials/libraries/libiconv/installation/installing_libiconv_on_ubuntu_linux.php)

After all that, you can install the Doxygen from source:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen.git
cd doxygen

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make

sudo make install
```

## Comment Blocks

1. You can use either
	```
	/** Line 1
	 *  Line 2
	 *  Line 3
	 */
	Constructor()
	```
	or
	
	```
	Constructor() /**< Line 1
		       *   Line 2
		       *   Line 3
		       */
	```
