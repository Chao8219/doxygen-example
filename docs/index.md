### To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time

> Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
>
> Old Time is still a-flying;
> 
> And this same flower that smiles today
> 
> To-morrow will be dying.
> 
> The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
> 
> The higher he's a-getting,
> 
> The sooner will his race be run,
> 
> And nearer he's to setting.
> 
> That age is best which is the first,
> 
> When youth and blood are warmer;
> 
> But being spent, the worse, and worst
> 
> Times still succeed the former.
> 
> Then be not coy, but use your time,
> 
> And, while ye may, go marry:
> 
> For having lost but once your prime,
> 
> You may forever tarry.
